\title{Adjusted P-values for Fixed Sequence FDR Controlling Procedures under Independence}
\usage{
FSFDR.indept.p.adjust(p, alpha=0.05, k=1, tol = 1e-6, make.decision = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{numeric vector of p-values (possibly with \code{\link[base]{NA}}s). Any other R is coerced by \code{\link[base]{as.numeric}}. Same as in \code{\link[stats]{p.adjust}}.}

\item{alpha}{significant level used to compare with adjusted p-values to make decisions, the default value is 0.05.}

\item{k}{pre-specified number of acceptances allowed in the testing procedure (cannot exceed the length of \code{p})}

\item{tol}{desired accuracy. The default value is \code{1e-6 }.}

\item{make.decision}{logical; if  \code{TRUE} (default), then the output include the decision rules compared adjusted p-values with significant level \eqn{alpha}}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the adjusted p-values (of the same length as \code{p}) if  \code{make.decision = FALSE}, or  a data frame including original p-values, adjusted p-values and decision rules if \code{make.decision = TRUE}.
}
\description{
Given a set of pre-ordered p-values and accuracy for the result, returns adjusted p-values using the generalized fixed sequence multiple testing procedures under independence for true nulls (See Theorem 3.2 and 4.2 in Lynch et al. (2016)). The function also provides an option to make decisions given a pre-specified significant level \eqn{\alpha}.
}
\details{
The generalized fixed sequence procedures designed to control FDR should be stop on the \eqn{k}-th acceptances and automatically accept the rest of hypotheses, where \eqn{k} is a pre-specified positive integer. When \eqn{k=1}, the generalized procedure becomes conventional one (Theorem 3.2 in Lynch et al. (2016)), which stops testing once one acceptance appears.
 This method strongly control FDR if the true null p-valuesare mutually independent and are independent of the false null p-values. When k=1, the conventional procedure strongly controls FDR if  the p-values are negatively associated on thetrue null p-values.

\examples{
## generate a pre-ordered pvalue vector for 50 hypotheses, where 60\% are true nulls
set.seed(1234); n <- 50; pi0 <- 0.6
mu <- sample(c(0,3), n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(pi0,1-pi0))
Zstat <- rnorm(n = n, mean = mu)
Pval <- 1-pnorm(Zstat)
## conventional fixed sequence procedure
FSFDR.indept.p.adjust(p = Pval, alpha = 0.05)
## generalized fixed sequence procedure allowing stop at 5th acceptance
FSFDR.indept.p.adjust(p = Pval, alpha = 0.05, k=5)
