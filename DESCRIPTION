Description: The FixSeqMTP package is designed to test a sequence of pre-
    ordered hypotheses using several generalized Fixed Sequence Multiple Testing
    Procedures (g-FSMTPs). The proposed three FWER controlling g-FSMTPs utilize
    numbers of rejections and acceptances, all of the procedures are designed under
    arbitrary dependence. The proposed two FDR controlling g-FSMTPs allows more but
    a given number of acceptances (>=1), the procedures are designed for arbitrary
    dependence and independence. The main functions for each proposed g-FSMTPs are
    designed to calculate adjusted p-values and critical values, respectively. For
    users' convenience, the output results also include the option of decision rules
    for convenience.
